# Observer-Eye Platform Objectives

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Unified Observability
Consolidate metrics, logs, traces, and events into a single platform, eliminating the need for multiple monitoring tools.

### 2. Real-time Visibility
Provide instant visibility into system health and application performance with sub-second data updates.

### 3. Actionable Insights
Transform raw observability data into actionable insights through AI-powered analytics and recommendations.

### 4. Scalability
Handle enterprise-scale data volumes while maintaining performance and reliability.

### 5. Security First
Implement security best practices at every layer, from authentication to data encryption.

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| MTTR/MTTS Compatibility | > 90% |
| Data ingestion latency | < 100ms |
| Dashboard load time | < 2s |
| Query response time | < 500ms |
| System availability | 99.9% |

## Business Goals

- **Zero-Mock Visibility**: 100% real-time system reflection.
- **Reduce MTTR** (Mean Time To Resolution) by 50%.
- **Zero-Trust Infrastructure**: Enforce mTLS and OIDC globally.
- **Intelligent Forecasting**: Enable proactive monitoring with AI-powered trends.
