  "product_overview": "Observer-Eye is a comprehensive observability platform designed with a three-layer architecture (Presentation, Logic, Data) to ingest, analyze, and visualize metrics, logs, traces, and events, enabling enterprises to gain deep insights and predictive analytics on their system performance and security.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Implement a scalable and secure three-layer architecture: Presentation (Angular 21), Logic (FastAPI Middleware), Data (Django Backend).",
    "Support the four pillars of observability: Metrics, Logs, Traces, and Events across the platform.",
    "Ensure high security standards including robust password policies and OAuth integration with GitHub, GitLab, Google, and Microsoft.",
    "Deliver modular, high-performance middleware with features like caching, streaming, telemetry, error handling, and CRUD operations.",
    "Provide backend services covering analytics, APM, notifications, integrations, insights, and template dashboards.",
    "Enable seamless integration between presentation, middleware, and backend layers with secure and performant APIs.",
    "Support containerization via Docker with best practices and optimized build times.",
    "Provide documentation covering architecture, features, business solutions, and cross-platform support."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Comprehensive Observability Core API for ingesting and retrieving observability data (metrics, logs, traces, events).",
    "Query Engine API supporting PromQL-like queries for flexible metrics querying.",
    "AI-powered Insights API for anomaly detection and predictive analytics.",
    "Notification API supporting multi-channel alert dispatch (email, Slack, etc.).",
    "Dashboard Templates API to manage, import, and export visualization templates.",
    "Analytics & Reporting API generating customizable reports in PDF and CSV formats.",
    "Presentation layer with Angular 21 UI components including authentication (OAuth and password management), dashboards, and various UI services.",
    "Middleware logic layer on FastAPI offering performance optimizations, data transformation/validation, caching, testing, streaming, telemetry, error handling, and exposing clean CRUD APIs.",
    "Data layer backend built with Django managing various monitoring and performance modules (APM, security metrics, system metrics, network metrics, etc.).",
    "Dockerized deployment with separate optimized Dockerfiles for backend, middleware, and frontend, along with docker-compose orchestration.",
    "Comprehensive documentation: architecture, feature sets, business benefits, and cross-platform support."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User accesses the Angular 21 presentation layer on port 80 to sign in using password or OAuth via GitHub, GitLab, Google, or Microsoft.",
    "Upon authentication, users navigate dashboards, view observability data, and manage components and templates.",
    "UI requests are routed to FastAPI middleware layer on port 8400 which handles business logic, data validation, caching, telemetry, and CRUD operations.",
    "Middleware interacts with Django backend data layer APIs to ingest, query, and retrieve observability data spanning metrics, logs, traces, and events.",
    "Users can execute PromQL-like queries via the Query Engine API and receive processed results for visualization.",
    "Users receive anomaly detection insights and predictive alerts via the AI Insights API integrated into dashboards and notifications.",
    "Alerts can be created and managed in the Notification API with dispatch via various channels.",
    "Users can generate analytical reports in multiple formats through the Analytics & Reporting API.",
    "Admins can manage dashboard templates, import and export them to customize user views.",
    "All layers and services are containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scaling, ensuring security best practices."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "End-to-end testing of user authentication flows including OAuth and password strength validations.",
    "Successful ingestion and retrieval of metrics, logs, traces, and events through Core Observability API.",
    "Accurate and performant execution of PromQL-like queries via Query Engine API.",
    "Effective anomaly detection and predictive insights verified through AI Insights API outputs.",
    "Reliable alert creation and dispatch through Notification API across configured channels.",
    "Complete lifecycle management of dashboard templates with import/export functionalities.",
    "Generation of analytics reports in requested formats (PDF, CSV) with correct data representation.",
    "UI components render correctly and provide seamless navigation across dashboards and features.",
    "Middleware layer performs data transformation, validation, caching, error handling, and CRUD operations reliably under load.",
    "Docker containers build under 5 minutes each with security best practices, and docker-compose brings up all services as expected.",
    "Comprehensive documentation is available covering architecture, technical features, business value, and supports all major platforms including Linux, macOS, and Windows."
